Sharing my Visual Basic school assignment - a simple calculator -

This repository contains a humble contribution to the world of programming with a basic calculator project implemented in Visual Basic, developed as part of a school assignment. The calculator offers fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's a stepping stone in my learning journey, serving as a platform to grasp essential programming concepts in Visual Basic. I aim to use this project to document my progress and look back on my learning journey. Your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are greatly appreciated!
